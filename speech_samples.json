The Secretary of State has made it clear that there are no arrangements of any sort for talks between the board and the mining unions between now and Thursday morning, when the closure of the industry follows under the Mines and Quarries Act 1954, because it will be illegal for miners to dig coal in any pit unless there is safety cover of the sort that can be given only by those who hold the overmen's certificate.\nI urge you not to allow a matter of this importance to be considered solely in a question and answer session, unsatisfactory as that is bound to be, but to give the House of Commons, after a long recess, and the public, who have waited to hear the arguments presented, an opportunity tomorrow to discuss what the Minister said and some of the points that have been only touched on in the exchange.

That was what moved him.\nSecondly, he was a man who always said the same, wherever he was. Whether one heard him in public at a meeting or in private, whether one heard him in the Cabinet or in the House of Commons, he always said the same thing. For that reason, he was trusted.
