Caroline Lucas,"The right hon. Gentleman said a moment ago that the great repeal Bill will give us some certainty, so may I ask him for certainty on environmental legislation in particular? Even when EU legislation has been enshrined in UK law, we need to know, first, the extent to which any future changes to environmental safeguards will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and vote; and, secondly, what kind of accountability mechanisms he imagines will be in place. Once we are out of the EU, we lose access to the European Court of Justice and the Commission. How will that environmental legislation become judiciable? I am sure that, like me, the hon. and learned Gentleman welcomes the half U-turn from the Government, allowing a debate before article 50 is invoked, but what about an actual vote?

The Government's plans to try to bridge the gap are likely to be funded through a levy on consumer bills, but that does not take into account the fact that this perversely hits the fuel poor hardest. What account has the Secretary of State taken of the Government's own figures, which estimate that although options such as an extension of CERT-the carbon emissions reduction target-might take between 21,000 and 31,000 households out of fuel poverty, the impact via increased fuel bills is that it results in 70,000 to 150,000 households being put into fuel poverty?",2010-11-11 00:00:00,Energy and Climate Change: Warm Front Scheme,24910,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-0.90,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-1.02,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-1.32,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-1.36,-1.26,-inf,-0.72,-inf,-inf,-inf,-0.47,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf

Gentleman can have listened to the reply that I have just given, which is that the unemployment benefit, when the increases announced after the Gracious Speech are in place, will be slightly higher than it was in real terms when we came into office. In so far as that is insufficient, there is, and should be, extra supplementary benefit available. The hon. Gentleman will also be aware that when child benefit is increased in November to the level announced in the last Budget, that also will be at a record level.",1983-07-05,Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Prime Minister: Trades Union Congress,19284,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-1.05,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-0.45,-0.35,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-1.37
Margaret Thatcher,"On present plans, early next year. As that candidate has had the support of our No. 1 politician in Scotland, the excellent Secretary of State for Scotland, I am sure that he is very pleased. I am sure that there is no better candidate than the young man who is standing for the Conservative Party. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. Our candidate, Jackson Carlaw, whom I met on Friday night, has found that people there appreciate the opportunity that Conservatives have given them to purchase their council houses, while the Labour Party wants to keep those tenants under control for ever. That contract was put out to tender. We had to purchase the most suitable houses for the people there and to house our troops. The last three in the tender were British firms. It is true that some used Swedish components, but that was because those components were the best available. The policy is to buy British where it is the best available or equal to the best available, but we must insist on purchasing the best available for the purpose.",1982-11-30,Oral Answers to Questions &#8212; Prime Minister: Glasgow,19284,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-0.58,-inf,-inf,-inf,-1.51,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-1.22,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-0.80,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-0.78,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf,-inf

Margaret Thatcher,"No, Sir. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has replied to the leader of the city council. How housing resources within the city's allocation are to be used is a matter for the council to decide. I am delighted to be in such demand. Every hon. Member wants me to visit his constituency— The housing investment programme allocation this year

is £47 million, which is an increased share of regional resources reflecting Liverpool's needs. The Government have also allocated £17.5 million under the urban programme for 1980-81, which is a real increase on last year. In addition, we are trying to make Speke an enterprise zone—I realise that it is not in the hon. Gentleman's constituency—which will help to create new employment. Almost every hon. Member wants to bring a deputation to see me. They should go to the Minister concerned—in this case, the Secretary of State for the Environment or the Secretary of State for Employment.

Margaret Thatcher,"The arrangements for Prime Minister's questions have been reviewed twice by Select Committees in recent years, and I am not sure how much further progress we would make by appointing another Committee now. I am very willing to answer substantive questions if they are tabled, and I hope that hon. Members will take the opportunity to put down more of them. I have never transferred a single oral question which has been put to me. I am wholly in favour of what my hon. Friend is saying. Substantive questions are the easiest to answer. No one can be sure that a particular job will exist in X years' time. It is impossible to be sure. Many jobs now are concerned with products which did not exist 10 years ago, let alone 20 years ago.

The whole question of the arms trade, which was denounced by four bishops in a letter in The Times yesterday, is the real and on-going issue.
