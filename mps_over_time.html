            <h3><span style="padding-right: 5rem;">By <b><a href="https://pudding.cool/author/durand-dsouza" style="text-decoration: none;">Durand D'souza</a></b></span><span><b>June 25, 2018</b></span></h3>
            <p>
                This year marks a century since some women in the United Kingdom were awarded the right to vote in and stand for elections. Since then, 490 different women have represented their constituents in the House of Commons, bringing the Commons to 32% women. In this article, we follow their stories through data and identify their contributions with the help of machine learning.

                            A socialite-turned-revolutionary, she spent her life campaigning on behalf of working people, fought in the Easter Rising against the British, and got herself elected to the first Irish Dáil (parliament) while serving a jail sentence.

                            <hr /> The first woman to take her seat was MP Viscountess Nancy Astor, in 1919. Despite her 26-year tenure in parliament being met with sexism and derision from other MPs, she campaigned for lowering the voting age of women to 21, better pensions for widows, employment rights, the expansion of nursery schools, and for better representation of women in the civil sector. She arrived in the House of Commons as the only woman MP and left in 1945 as a record 24 women were elected.

                            In 1961, Baroness Margaret Thatcher was elected as the MP of Finchley in North London, and she led the Conservative Party to landslide victory in 1979 in one of the most important political upheavals in British history.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                                By breaking through the ultimate glass ceiling in British politics, Thatcher was an important role model and inspired many women to enter politics. Her overall contribution to women’s participation in politics is less certain. In her 11 years as Prime Minister, she promoted only one woman to her cabinet and did not champion any feminist causes. It took another 26 years (and four male PMs) until another woman—Theresa May—led the UK government.

                            The controversial decision to use AWS (a process in which only women are allowed to stand for candidate selection in certain seats) faced opposition on the grounds that it was discriminatory. Legal challenges were later nullified by legislation passed in parliament.

                    In 2018, there are <b>209</b> women MPs, which, while significant, is still a long way from gender parity. For every woman currently in the House of Commons, there are twice as many men.

                    The breakdown also varies by party. In 2018, 45% of Labour's MPs are women. In part due to all women shortlists, there are currently more women Labour MPs than all the other parties combined (and at a time when the Labour Party is in opposition).

                    But only 21% of current Conservative MPs are women. A Conservative landslide election could cause a significant step backwards in progress towards equal gender representation unless the party puts more women forward as <a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/@dldx/gender-distribution-of-candidates-in-marginal-seats" target="_blank">parliamentary candidates in marginal seats</a>.

                    While approximately a 32% of MPs in the UK are women, it’s important to place the imbalance in context of other countries. Is the UK progressive, or does it pale in comparison to other governments in gender representation?

For Norway, this is the <em>Stortinget</em>. For Mexico, it's the <em>Cámara de Diputados</em>. For the United States,

                        The Nordic countries lead in equal gender representation, although Mexico has also made great strides and is progressing much quickly than the UK despite the fact that both countries started with the same gender representation in 2002.

                    <p>
                        In fact, the UK is a rather middle of the road performer. None of these countries has made it to gender parity. In fact, the only two countries in the world to meet or exceed 50% women in governing bodies are Bolivia and Rwanda, both of which also have gender quotas.

                        With gender parity, constituents might hope that elected officials focus on more inclusive issues. To better understand how a gender shift in the House of Commons might affect the topics debated, consider the speeches made by MPs in the main chamber.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We compiled a collection of of 1.2 million speeches delivered by men and women who have served in the House of Commons since 1970, including monologues, debates, single-sentence replies, and acknowledgments.

                        We then used a probabilistic machine learning model<span class="footnote"><sup>1</sup><span>While there are a number of different machine learning techniques that can do this, including neural networks, the beauty of <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@lettier/how-does-lda-work-ill-explain-using-emoji-108abf40fa7d">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> (LDA) is that it is an unsupervised learning algorithm.

We label <b>Topic 1</b> as <i>“nhs”</i> and <b>Topic 2</b> as <i>“education”</i>.

                        Here is the topic “economy.” Each circle represents one MP, with men on the left and women on the right. The higher the circle, the greater the proportion of their time was spent on the economy.

                    <p>
                        Men and women appear to devote roughly the same amount of their speeches to the economy. Next let’s take a look at another topic, one to which women tend to devote more parliamentary time.

                        While welfare reform is an important topic for all MPs, women spend more than twice the amount of their speeches discussing reform than men. Now let's examine a topic favored by men: parliamentary terminology.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="4" data-step="3">

                        This time, we see that men spend twice as much time talking about parliamentary terminology.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    Let's take the median difference between men and women for parliamentary terminology (depicted as a line) and plot it against all other topics.

                        A difference of +100% (eg. “<i>education</i>”) means that women are twice as likely as men to refer to the topic in a speech. A difference of -100% means the opposite: men are twice as likely as women to refer to the topic in a speech.

                        Parliamentary candidates for the next general election are yet to be selected, so it is still too early to tell if the next election will see an improvement in representation. Ultimately, what matters is not <i>how many</i> women candidates stand for election, but rather where they stand.
                        Candidates selected in marginal seats are much more likely to be elected than those who run in safe seats which do not change party hands.

                    In the 2017 general election, only <a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/@dldx/gender-distribution-of-candidates-in-marginal-seats" target="_blank">38% of candidates</a> in winnable seats were women<span class="footnote"><sup>1</sup><span>Winnable seats are defined as those with less than 5% vote share between the top two parties.</span></span>. In order to achieve gender parity, this number will need to be much greater than 50% to overcome the huge gender imbalance in non-marginal seats which do not change hands often, and are thus <a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/@dldx/gender-distribution-of-candidates-in-marginal-seats#non_marginal_seats" target="_blank">mostly</a> occupied by veteran male MPs.

                    <a href="https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/why-arent-there-more-women-british-politics" target="_blank">Academic research</a> overwhelmingly finds that the lack of gender equality in parliament is a demand-side problem: parties are not selecting enough women, rather than not enough women standing. This is particularly true of the Conservative party, which must select significantly more women candidates in marginal constituencies.

            Parliament is meant to be representative. It should draw upon the widest possible pools of talent and experience. Women make a massive contribution to society in their paid and unpaid work. All people deserve representation in the most important decision-making institution in our country.

            Yet men continue to outnumber women by more than 2:1 in the corridors of power. At the last election, only 12 extra women were elected. At this rate it will take over 50 years for full gender parity.
