            <h2>100 Years of Women in the House of Commons</h2>
            <p>
                This year marks a century since women in the United Kingdom were first awarded the right to vote in and stand for elections. Today, in early 2018, there are 208 women from various parties and political persuasions serving their constituents in the House
                of Commons. So how did we arrive here? And what contribution have women MPs made to democracy in the UK? Let's dive in and take a look!

                            A socialite-turned-revolutionary, she spent her life campaigning on behalf of working people, fought in the Easter Rising against the British, and got herself elected to the first Irish Dáil (parliament) while serving a jail

                            <hr /> The first woman to take her seat was MP Viscountess Nancy Astor, in 1919. Despite her 26 year tenure in Parliament being met with sexism and derision from other MPs, she campaigned for lowering the voting age of women to 21,
                            better pensions for widows, employment rights, the expansion of nursery schools, and for better representation of women in the civil sector. She arrived in the House of Commons as the only female MP and left in 1945 as a record
                            24 women were elected.

                            <p>In 1961, Baroness Margaret Thatcher was elected as the MP of Finchley in North London. She led the Conservative Party to victory in 1979 in one of the most important political upheavals in British history.</p>

                                By breaking through the ultimate glass ceiling in British politics, Margaret Thatcher was an important role model and inspired many women to enter politics. Her overall contribution to women’s participation in politics is less certain. In her 11 years
                                as Prime Minister, she promoted only one woman to her cabinet and did not champion any feminist causes. It took another 26 years (and four male PMs) until another woman (Theresa May) lead the UK government.

                        <p>
The controversial decision to use AWS (a process in which only women are allowed to stand for candidate selection in certain seats) faced opposition on the grounds it was discriminatory. Legal challenges were later nullified by legislation passed in Parliament.
</p>

<p>
While the merits and pitfalls of AWS are still being debated, there is no doubt that they have helped improve the representation of women in Parliament.

                    While in 2018, <b>208</b> female MPs is significant, we still haven't hit gender parity yet. In fact, for every woman in the House of Commons in 2018, there are two men. Hover/tap on the graph to see each parliament's ratio of men to women.

                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="1">
                     The situation for women is also very party dependent. In 2018, 45% of Labour's MPs are women, thanks in part to all women shortlists, there are currently more women Labour MPs than all the other parties combined (and at a time when the Labour Party is in opposition).
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="2">
                    But only 21% of Conservative MPs are currently women. This presents a problem, because a Conservative landslide election could cause a significant step backwards in our journey towards a 50:50 Parliament.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="3">
                    For smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, women make up about a third of their ranks.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="4">
                    Okay, so now we know that 32% of MPs in the UK are women, how does this compare to other developed countries? Let's take a look!
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="2" style="opacity: 0;">
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="2">
                    Right! On this graph, we see the % of women elected to the equivalent of the House of Commons in other developed countries. For Norway, this is the <em>Stortinget</em>, for Mexico, <em>Cámara de Diputados</em>, for the United States,
                    it is the <em>House of Representatives</em>. As usual, the Nordic countries lead the pack. Mexico has also made great strides and is progressing much quicker than the UK despite the fact that both countries started at the same point
                    in 2002. In fact, the UK is a rather middle of the road performer. You may also note that none of these countries have made it to equal gender representation yet. In fact, the only two countries in the world to meet this threshold
                    are Bolivia and Rwanda.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="3" data-step="0">
                    At this point, you may be thinking - <em>great, I've seen how much progress we've made. I've been introduced to a few women. And I know how much further we have to go. But why? What does equal gender representation give us that we don't have already?</em>
                    <p/> That's a fair question. There are three main reasons why I believe in equal representation:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The UK is a representative democracy. This means that our representatives should share our values, as well as our diversity. The experiences of women can be vastly different to those of men. It is only fair that we value all experiences equally.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By improving the diversity of parliament, we are also drawing on a much bigger talent pool which can be hugely beneficial in solving some of the complex issues that government has to deal with.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The data shows that female and male MPs prioritise different topics in parliament. They may champion different causes, and as a result, empower different groups of people.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    On that last point, I'd like to present to you some of my own data analysis! Scroll on!

                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="3" data-step="1">
                    I kept reading articles about how passionate an MP was about something but as a data nerd, I wanted something quantifiable. So I set about finding a way.
                    <p/> I downloaded all speeches made by every MP elected since 1970. This equates to 1,213,728 individual speeches, from brief comments or questions to long filibusters, made by 1783 male and 335 female MPs. I then used a few machine learning
                    techniques to identify all the topics present in the whole corpus. For the data scientists - I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a popular method for identifying topics in data without any prior labelling. It was important to use LDA
                    because I had no idea what topics were even talked about in parliament, especially in the past, so I didn't want to spend too much time categorising the speeches myself. For more information on my method, check out the GitHub repo
                    for this project.
                    <p/> It's important to recognise that using machine learning in this way is very beneficial but it can also be imperfect and inaccurate. The longer the speech, the easier it is for the model to identify the topics within it due to the
                    statistical process underlying the model. In some instances, the model correctly identifies the most important topic but in other instances, it gets completely thrown off by similar words used in a different context. For example, a
                    speech about the law firm Mossack Fonseca being raided was miscategorised as "counter-terrorism" because of the word "raided". However, longer speeches do not suffer from these problems.
                    <p/> Let's take a look at some examples.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="3" data-step="2" style="opacity: 0;">
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="3" data-step="3" style="z-index: 100; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.93); color: #1a1a1a;">
                    Once I identified the topics within each speech given by an MP, I then added together all the fractions, weighted by the length of each speech so that the longer speeches have precedence. This tells us how long an MP spends on each topic. Let's see the
                    results.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="4" data-step="0">
                    This is just one topic identified by the model. In total, the model identified 100 different topics of which a large number were either nonsensical or irrelevant to our discussion. We focussed on the rest.
                    <p/> Each dot in this visual represents one MP. Hover/tap on each dot to identify them! The higher the dot, the more time has been spent talking about this topic. The line in between the dots represents the difference between the median
                    fractions of time spent by each gender.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="4" data-step="1">
                    Let's take this median line and plot it with the median lines of all the other topics and see if we can discern any interesting trends.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="5" style="opacity: 0;">

                <div class="step" data-slide="5">
                    Here you see how each gender favours particular topics. Female MPs talk more often about WELFARE REFORMS, CHILD CARE, the NHS, and EDUCATION. Male MPs, on average, spend more time talking about LEGISLATION, ENERGY, the EUROPEAN UNION and the ARMED FORCES.
                    Ultimately, there is a lot of variation between MPs regardless of gender but there is still an overall gender bias towards these topics.

            <p/> So let's wrap this up! My topic modelling analysis shows that certain topics are more attractive to certain genders. This disparity between genders exists even after accounting for party lines (which may influence the results due to female
            MPs belonging mostly to the Labour Party). It is important to keep in mind that these figures don't measure any kind of political views an MP might have. Two MPs might both talk about the NHS a lot, but one may be in favour of keeping it public
            while the other might be in favour of privatising it. This model can't differentiate between them.
            <p/> And while we could look at these topics and label "child care" a feminine subject and "economy" a masculine one, in reality, child care and economic policies affect both genders. Similarly, many of the topics identified are simply two sides
            of the same coin. Climate Change is biased towards women but energy is mentioned by men more often, despite the fact that they should be addressed collectively. Perhaps our most polarised topics are simply gendered manifestations of the same
            ones, where men and women might use different words but in reality, care about the same overarching subject.

            <p/> There is a lot more that can be derived from this and other datasets and future articles may address these. I would particularly like to answer questions such as:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Do women selected in All Women Shortlists behave differently to those who weren't?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How do the speech styles of men and women differ? Do men use filibusters more often? Are women easier to understand?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How are male and female MPs characterised differently in newspapers, on TV or on social media?
                </li>
            </ul>

            Until then, thanks for reading!
