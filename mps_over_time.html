            <h2>100 Years of Women in the House of Commons</h2>
            <p>
                This year marks a century since women in the United Kingdom were first awarded the right to vote in and stand for elections. Today, in early 2018, there are 208 women from various parties and political persuasions serving their constituents in the House
                of Commons. So how did we arrive here? And what contribution have women MPs made to democracy in the UK? Let's dive in and take a look!
            </p>

                            A socialite-turned-revolutionary, she spent her life campaigning on behalf of working people, fought in the Easter Rising against the British, and got herself elected to the first Irish Dáil (parliament) while serving a jail

                            <hr /> The first woman to take her seat was MP Viscountess Nancy Astor, in 1919. Despite her 26 year tenure in parliament being met with sexism and derision from other MPs, she campaigned for lowering the voting age of women to 21,
                            better pensions for widows, employment rights, the expansion of nursery schools, and for better representation of women in the civil sector. She arrived in the House of Commons as the only female MP and left in 1945 as a record
                            24 women were elected.

                            In 1961, Baroness Margaret Thatcher was elected as the MP of Finchley in North London, and led the Conservative Party to landslide victory in 1979 in one of the most important political upheavals in British history.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                                By breaking through the ultimate glass ceiling in British politics, Thatcher was an important role model and inspired many women to enter politics. Her overall contribution to women’s participation in politics is less certain. In her 11 years as Prime
                                Minister, she promoted only one woman to her cabinet and did not champion any feminist causes. It took another 26 years (and four male PMs) until another woman - Theresa May - lead the UK government.

                            Half of these <em>new</em> Labour women MPs had been selected through All Women Shortlists (AWS, for short).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The controversial decision to use AWS (a process in which only women are allowed to stand for candidate selection in certain seats) faced opposition on the grounds it was discriminatory. Legal challenges were later nullified by legislation passed in parliament.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While the merits and pitfalls of AWS are still being debated, there is no doubt that they have helped improve the representation of women in parliament.

                    <b>208</b> women MPs is significant, but we still haven't hit 50:50 yet. In fact, for every woman in the House of Commons today, there are twice as many men. Hover/tap on the graph to see each parliament's ratio of men to women.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="1">
                    The situation for women is also very party dependent. In 2018, 45% of Labour's MPs are women. Thanks in part to all women shortlists, there are currently more female Labour MPs than all the other parties combined (and at a time when the Labour Party is
                    in opposition).
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="2">
                    But only 21% of Conservative MPs are currently women. This presents a problem, because a Conservative landslide election could cause a significant step backwards in our progress towards a 50:50 parliament.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="3">
                    For smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, women make up about a third of their ranks.

                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="4">
                    Overall, 32% of MPs in the UK are women. How does this compare to other developed countries? Let's take a look!

                    <p>
                        Right! On this graph, we see the % of women elected to the equivalent of the House of Commons in other developed countries. For Norway, this is the <em>Stortinget</em>, for Mexico, <em>Cámara de Diputados</em>, for the United States,
                        it is the <em>House of Representatives</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As usual, the Nordic countries lead the pack. Mexico has also made great strides and is progressing much quicker than the UK despite the fact that both countries started at the same point in 2002.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, the UK is a rather middle of the road performer. You may also note that none of these countries have made it to equal gender representation yet. In fact, the only two countries in the world to meet this threshold are Bolivia and Rwanda.
                    </p>

                        At this point, you may be thinking - <em>great, I've seen how much progress we've made. I've been introduced to a few prominent MPs. And I know how much further we have to go. But why? What does a 50:50 parliament give us that we don't have already?</em>

                    <p>
                        Let’s look at how much time MPs spend in parliament speaking about different issues. We collected and analysed the data using machine learning.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="4" data-step="0">
                    <p>

                        Here’s the chart for the topic “Economy”. Each dot in this chart represents one MP (from 1970 to today). The higher the dot, the greater the proportion of their time in parliament was spent talking about the economy. Hover/tap on each dot to see who they
                        are and their percentage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Men and women appear to give the economy roughly equal weighting. Next let’s take a look at another topic, one which women tend to devote more parliamentary time to.

                    <p>

                    Let's take this median line and plot it with the median lines of all the other topics.

                        So female MPs spend more of their time than men time talking about <i>welfare reforms</i>, <i>child care</i>, the <i>NHS</i> and <i>social care</i>...

                        ...and male MPs spend more of their time than women talking about the <i>legislation</i>, <i>energy</i>, the <i>european union</i> and the <i>armed forces</i>.

                        On this final graph, we show the number of women from all parties who were selected as candidates for parliament. Many more women would have stood to represent their party but did not get selected by their local party.

                        Parliamentary candidates for the next general election are yet to be selected so it is still too early to tell if the next election will see an improvement in representation.
                        Ultimately, what matters is not <i>how many</i> female candidates run, but rather <i>where</i> they run. Candidates elected to marginal seats are much more likely to be elected than those who run in safe seats which do not change party hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the 2017 general election, only <a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/@dldx/gender-distribution-of-candidates-in-marginal-seats" target="_blank">38% of candidates</a> in winnable seats were women<span class="footnote"><sup>1</sup><span>Winnable seats are defined as those with less than 5% vote share between the top two parties.</span></span>. In order to achieve real progress however, this number will need to be much greater than 50% in order to overcome the huge gender imbalance in non-marginal seats which do not change hands often, and are thus <a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/@dldx/gender-distribution-of-candidates-in-marginal-seats#non_marginal_seats" target="_blank">mostly</a> occupied by veteran male MPs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/why-arent-there-more-women-british-politics" target="_blank">Academic research</a> overwhelmingly demonstrates that the lack of gender equality in parliament is a demand-side problem - that is, it is a problem of parties not selecting enough women rather than enough women not standing. This is particularly true of the Conservative party, which must try harder to select significantly more women candidates in marginal constituencies.

                So let’s wrap this up! Here are the three main reasons why <a href="https://5050parliament.co.uk/?utm_source=data-viz&utm_campaign=data-viz&utm_content=viz-footer">50:50 Parliament</a> is campaigning for a gender balanced parliament:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Parliament is meant to be representative and should draw upon the widest possible pools of talent and experience. Women make a massive contribution to society in their paid and unpaid work. They merit fair representation and inclusion in the most important decision-making institution in our country.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Men continue to outnumber women by more than 2:1 in the corridors of power.  At the last election only 12 extra women were elected, at this rate it will take over 50 years for full gender equality. 50:50 are impatient for change and aspire to a more gender balanced, inclusive parliament sooner than that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All political parties and over 50,000 signatories to the 50:50 petition agree that a gender balanced parliament would be more representative and better informed.
                </li>
            </ol>

            If you know a woman who would make a great MP, <a href="https://5050parliament.co.uk/askhertostand/">ask her to stand</a>. If you would like to stand yourself, check out the <a href="https://5050parliament.co.uk/">50:50 Parliament</a> website for more details.
